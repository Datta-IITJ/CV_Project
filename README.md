# CV_Project
This is the Computer Vision project 1.

The main objective of the project is to explore different ways of protecting image copyright through image watermarking and identifying potential flaws in the process.
The project will implement watermarking techniques such as visible and invisible watermarking through logos and text and evaluate their effectiveness in protecting copyright.
After then it will implement techniques to remove that watermark from the watermarked images, so as to receive almost original images again. The project will also explore potential flaws or weaknesses in the watermarking process and develop strategies to strengthen image protection. Ultimately, it will also use evaluation measures to check watermarking techniques used and give results accordingly, so that we could compare these techniques.<br>
Here is the logo we have used for watermarking purpose<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/3.jpeg" alt="image_description" width="300"/><br>
 </p>
After adding this and removing we got the following images: <br><br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/77.png" alt="image_description" width="750"/><br>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="Images/WhatsApp Image 2023-03-18 at 7.08.12 PM.jpeg" alt="image_description" width="300"/>
</p>

We have also used text at random positions for watermarking as well.
